\question{1}

\question{2.i}
Claim:\\
Let f: a -> b and x and y be subsets of a, then:\\
$f[x \cup y] = f[x] \cup f[y]$

To prove this we show that the LHS is a subset of the RHS, and the RHS is a subset of the LHS.

Part 1: $LHS \subseteq RHS$\\
First, let an arbitrary element $t$ be a member of $f[x \cup y]$. Then by the defn of image,\\
we know that there exists $u$ such that $f(u) = t$ and $u \in (x \cup y)$.\\
By the defn of union, $u$ must be in either $x$ or $y$.\\
Then $t$ is in either $f[x]$ or $f[y]$, so it is in $f[x] \cup f[y]$, which is the RHS.\\
Therefore any element $t$ which is a member of the LHS is also a member of the RHS.\\
Then $LHS \subseteq RHS$

Part 2: $RHS \subseteq LHS$\\
Consider element $t$ in $f[x] \cup f[y]$.\\
Then there is an element $u$ either in $x$ or $y$ such that $f(u) = t$.\\
Then $u$ is in $x \cup y$. Then $t$ is in $f[x \cup y]$, so every element in the RHS is also in the LHS.
Then $RHS \subseteq LHS$

\question{2.ii}
We want to show that every element in $f[x \cap y]$ is also in $f[x] \cap f[y]$.\\
Consider an arbitrary element $t$ in $f[x \cap y]$.\\
By the definition of image, there exists a $u$ such that $f(u) = t$ and $u \in x \cap y$.\\
By the defn of binary intersection, $u$ is in both $x$ and $y$.\\
Then $t$ is in both $f[x]$ and $f[y]$, so $t \in f[x] \cap f[y]$, proving\\
that $LHS \subseteq RHS$.\\

\question{2.iii}
I conjecture that the formula is true when $f$ is injective.\\

If an element $t$ is in $f[x]$ and $f[y]$, then there is an element $u$ such that $f(u) = t$ and $u \in x$.\\
There is also an element $v$ such that $f(v) = t$ and $v \in y$.

If $f$ is injective, then $f(v) = t \wedge f(u) = t \implies v = u$.\\
Then we can say $v \in y => u \in y$, so $u \in x \cap y$, and $t \in f[x \cap y]$.

Fitch Proof of (ii):\\
