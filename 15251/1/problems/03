Art Majors love the golden ratio because it is believed to be "pleasing to
the eye" (much unlike some of their paintings).  Write us a program using
the ∈MATH language which when run takes a single number N as input,
calculates and outputs the Nth Fibonacci Number followed by a newline
character, and terminates.

(If N=0, your program should output 0; if N=1, your program should output 1)

(Note: If you try to be sneaky and not write your program in ∈MATH, you
       will regret it later.)

We have set up a way for you to submit your program to help us plead with
the Secret Society of Art Majors. If you are running the shell you used 
to download the problems, you can use the command

	submit_programming 03 "YOUR_INTERPRETER YOUR_PROGRAM_FILE"

to submit your solution.  So, if your interpreter is ./interpret
and your program is fib.em, then you would use the command

	submit_programming 03 "./interpret fib.em"

You will be given a single response that tells you if your program
works or not.

Good luck, godspeed, and remember...
We're /counting/ on you!
