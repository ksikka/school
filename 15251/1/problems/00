To start your journey to find the elements of math, we need you to figure
out what the following letters mean.

	cwu msubillings csumb suu
	wsc uwyo fortlewis ku ecok utep unm
	csu bsu uakron bloomu ucf

The "Secret Society of Art Majors" who we believe took the elements of 
math has set up a way for you to correspond with them.  If you are 
running the shell you used to download the problems, you can use the 
command

	submit_normal 00

to submit your solution.  You will be challenged three times to make 
sure that your answer is actually correct.  Be careful---a single
wrong answer will cause your whole solution to be incorrect.
Also, we've heard that art majors don't like forgeries...so, don't
try to submit too often.

Good luck, godspeed, and remember...
EDUcate yourself!
