We had another idea of how we could offer an olive branch to the Art
Majors.  We've decided to make macaroni and bead necklaces.  If we
have N+1 macaronis on the necklace, then there must be N beads to
make it look pretty.

Write a program that takes a number N as standard input and outputs
the number of UNIQUE necklaces we can make with N beads followed by
a newline character.

Two necklaces are considered "the same" if and only if one can be 
rotated to match the other.  If a necklace must be flipped to match 
another necklace, those two are considered different.

We have set up a way for you to submit your program to help us plead with
the Secret Society of Art Majors. If you are running the shell you used 
to download the problems, you can use the command

	submit_programming 08 "A_WAY_TO_RUN_YOUR_PROGRAM_ON_THE_COMMAND_LINE"

to submit your solution.  So, if you wrote your program in python,
and you called it macaroni.py, then you would use the command

	submit_programming 08 "python macaroni.py"

You will be given a single response that tells you if your program
works or not.

Good luck, godspeed, and remember...
We chose you!
