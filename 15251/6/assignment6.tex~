\begin{question}{Like a fly in a web}
\textbf{Part a}

Let $P(n) = $``For all simple graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, 
this algorithm produces a bipartition in which 
at least $\frac{m}{2}$ of the edges cross the partition."

The proof is by induction on $n$.

\textbf{Base case:} $(n=1)$\\
$m$ must be 0 since there are no vertices to connect to. 
The algorithm does nothing, and $\frac{m}{2} = 0$ so $P(1) =$ true.

\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:}
For some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, for all simple graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, 
this algorithm produces a bipartition in which 
at least $\frac{m}{2}$ of the edges cross the partition.

\textbf{Inductive Step:}
Add a vertex and connect it to $k$ of the $n$ other vertices. Then there are 
a total of $m+k$ edges

Place $n$ vertices on the left or the right according to the algorithm. By the IH, 
we know at least $\frac{m}{2}$ edges cross the center.

You have two options for the $(n+1)^{th}$ vertex: place it on the left or on the right.
If you place it on the left a set of edges $A$ will cross the center. If you place it
on the right, a set of edges $B$ will cross the center. $A \cap B = \null$ since 
no edge will cross the center in both cases (duh). Therefore, $|A| + |B| = k$.

The algorithm says to place the last vertex on the left or right so that 
the larger of $A$ and $B$ crosses the center. Without loss of generality, we'll
say that $A$ is larger and therefore crosses the center. 
\begin{align*}
|A| + |B| &= k\\
2|A| \geq |A| + |B| &= k\\
|A| &\geq \frac{k}{2}
\end{align*}

Therefore, at least $\frac{m}{2}+\frac{k}{2} = \frac{m+k}{2}$ edges will be cut.

\textbf{Part b}

\textbf{Claim:}\\
If the planar graph $G$ is isomorphic to its dual $G'$, then $G'$ has $2n-2$ edges.

Let $G$ have $n$ vertices, $e$ edges, and $f$ faces.
Let $G'$ have $n'$ vertices, $e'$ edges, and $f'$ faces.

\textbf{Fun Facts:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since $G \simeq G'$, there is a bijection between their vertex sets, so $n=n'$.
\item According to the definition stated in the problem, there is also a bijection 
between the sets of edges, so $e=e'$.
\item Since $G'$ is the dual of $G$, $n' = f$ because to form a dual of a graph, you 
put one vertex for every face of the graph.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{QEDmyGraph:}\\
Since $G'$ is the dual of $G$, and $G$ is planar, we know that $G'$ is planar
and therefore $n' + f' = e' + 2$
\begin{align*}
e' &= n' + f' - 2\\
   &= n + f' - 2\\
   &= n + n - 2\\
e' &= 2n - 2
\end{align*}

\end{question}
\begin{question}{Oh no, not again}
WTS: Consider a regular, bipartite graph G whose edges go only between A and B. 
Observe that the graph is regular (every node in G has the same degree). 
Assuming G has at least one edge, show that G has a perfect matching.
Also show that the edges of G are a union of disjoint perfect matchings.

(part a is by the lecture notes.)

say you have a set of all the perfect matchings

claim 1 - 2 perfect matchings have no 
 
claim 2
