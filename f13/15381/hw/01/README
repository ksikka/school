I implemented a pretty basic Random-restart hill climbing.

First the board is initialized with n-queens.
Then, in a loop:
  for each queen
    get a list of available positions the queen could move to, and their losses.
    find the position with the minimum loss, including the current position
      if there are multiple positions with the least loss, the choice is arbitrary
    move the queen to that position

If a local minimum is detected in the loop, the queens are randomly arranged and I restart
If no state is found where loss = 0 after n*20 restarts, I give up and assume the minimum loss state so far is a global minimum.
