<P>A multivariate hypothesis test was performed using the null hypothesis "There is no difference between image set 1 and image set 2 when compared using the assigned set of feature variables". The results of this test are shown below. If the F value is greater than the critical value then the hypothesis can be rejected at the given significance level alpha.</P>
