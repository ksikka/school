function y = genmix(npoints,mean,var,prob)
%
% y = genmix(npoints,mean,var,prob)
%
% Generates 'npoints' samples from a mixture
% of Gaussian densities.
% The dimension of the space is the number of
% lines of 'mean', while the number of components, 'comp',
% of the mixture is its number of columns. That is
% each column of 'mean' is the mean of one component
% of the mixture.
% Parameter 'var' must be a 3-dimensional array such that 
% var(:,:,i) is the covariance matrix of the i-th
% component of the mixture. Of course, size(var(:,:,i))
% must be [dim,dim].
% 'probs', contains the mixing probabilities of the 
% first comp-1 components. The comp-th one is, of course,
% 1-sum(comp)
