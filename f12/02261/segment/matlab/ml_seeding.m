% FUNCTION [nuclei_masks,nuclei_mask_all, nuclei_mask_outline] = ML_SEEDING(dna,resolution)
% dna is the image matrix of the dna channel
% resolution: unit is micron per pixel
% seeding method: 'global' or 'local'
%                 'global' = background substration 'lowCommon' 
%                            + global threshold ('nih'= Ridler)
%                            + majority to remove noise
%                 'local' = background substration 'lowCommon' 
%                           + an average filter is applied on a sliding window representing 12 microns of diameter (half the diameter of big nuclei, small diameter of nuclei in tissue sample)
%                           + local maxima are detected and only those with
%                           an intensity higher than 5% of the maximum
%                           intensity and the intensity higher than 10 are used to remove maxima due to uneven background
%                           + a threshold ('nih'=Ridler) is applied on windows of width 25 microns centered on each local maxima


% it is assumed that nuclei are larger than 5 microns and smaller than 25
% microns and with an intensity at leat 10-gray-level higher than the
% background. The background substration use the method 'lowCommon': the
% value of the most common intensity between zero and the mean intensity of
% the image is subtracted to the whole image.
