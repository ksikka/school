Art Majors are bad with large numbers, but make many strokes with their
pencils when drawing.  We're wondering how many characters an ∈MATH program
with N instructions can output (assuming the ∈MATH program halts).

Write a program that takes a number N as standard input and outputs the
concatenation of all valid ∈MATH program with N instructions which
output the most number of characters possible before halting followed by
a newline character.

You should sort your list of programs by the number of \rhd instructions 
they contain before concatenating them. If there is a tie in the number
of \rhd instructions, sort alphabetically.

We are only considering ∈MATH programs which do not take any input and do
not output integers. This means that the programs do not contain \lhd,
\unlhd, \unrhd.

We will also only test your program on small inputs (N < 9).

We have set up a way for you to submit your program to help us plead with
the Secret Society of Art Majors. If you are running the shell you used 
to download the problems, you can use the command

	submit_programming 04 "A_WAY_TO_RUN_YOUR_PROGRAM_ON_THE_COMMAND_LINE"

to submit your solution.  So, if you wrote your program in python,
and you called it progs.py, then you would use the command

	submit_programming 04 "python progs.py"

You will be given a single response that tells you if your program
works or not.

Good luck, godspeed, and remember...
Do...or halt.
