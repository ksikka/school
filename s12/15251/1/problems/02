The art majors have trapped one of our undercover operatives in an intricate
maze of rooms and passageways. Each room in the maze has a message, and each
passageway has a color. He starts at room 0 (the first checkpoint), and must
make his way from checkpoint to checkpoint to uncover the password to escape.

Each room's message contains a sequence of five colors. To help him make his
way from one checkpoint to the next, find a path with that exact color 
sequence. Be careful, though! Although some of the rooms' messages are useful, 
most are simply there to throw attention away from the important ones.

You are given a text file (02.graph) describing the maze, which has the
following format:

-The first line is the number of rooms, n.
-The next n lines each describe one room. The rooms are given in order of their
number. A line starts with the room's number, and the remainder of the line has
the room's message.
-The next line is the number of passageways, k.
-The next k lines each describe one passageway. Each passageway connects exactly
two rooms and has a particular color. The line has the following format:
[room1] [room2] [color]

Note: Although it's possible to go through the clues manually, it will likely
take a very long time. It is strongly recommended that you do some programming
for this problem.


The "Secret Society of Art Majors" who we believe took the elements of
math has set up a way for you to correspond with them.  If you are
running the shell you used to download the problems, you can use the
command

  submit_normal 02

to submit your solution.  You will be challenged three times to make
sure that your answer is actually correct.  Be careful---a single
wrong answer will cause your whole solution to be incorrect.
Also, we've heard that art majors don't like forgeries...so, don't
try to submit too often.

Good luck, godspeed, and remember...
There many be many paths of truth, but they will always have a unique
destination.
