Some of the recently graduated Art majors challenged us to a game of
our choosing.  We are considering proposing the following game:

The game begins with N stacks of K coins.  Each turn, the current team
chooses a stack and takes a non-zero number of coins from that stack.
The two groups (Art Majors and Us) alternate turns, and the game ends
when all the stacks are empty.  The last team to pick up coins wins.

Unlike the Art Major team, we're really busy; so, we want to know
how many turns on average a game would take us before agreeing to it.
For "simplicity", assume that every time each team moves, they choose
a coin at random and remove that coin and everything above it.

The "Secret Society of Art Majors" who we believe took the elements of 
math has set up a way for you to correspond with them.  If you are 
running the shell you used to download the problems, you can use the 
command

	submit_normal 12

to submit your solution.  You will be challenged three times to make 
sure that your answer is actually correct.  Be careful---a single
wrong answer will cause your whole solution to be incorrect.
Also, we've heard that art majors don't like forgeries...so, don't
try to submit too often.

Good luck, godspeed, and remember...
We're ready to go; the stacks are all in a row!
