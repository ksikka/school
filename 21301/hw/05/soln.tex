\question{1}
We know that a maximal chain of $[n]$ contains $n+1$ sets, and there is exactly one set of every size from 0 to $n$.

We know that the sizes of $A_i$ strictly increase in the order they are given (from 1 to $k$). That is that $A_1$ is the smallest and $A_k$ is the largest $A_i$.

We can construct all maximal chains of $[n]$ containing all $A_i$ by the following method:

Let your chain contain all $A_i$. This is a chain given the subset relationship of all the $A_i$.
Notice that this chain may not be maximal if there is not a set of every size from 0 to $n$.
We know that we have sets of sizes $|A_1|, |A_2|, ..., |A_k|$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Now, add a maximal chain of $2^{A_1}$.
\item Then find $|A_j| - |A_i|$ sets in $2^{[x]}$ of all sizes strictly between $(|A_i|, |A_j|)$ such that they form a chain, and add them to the chain.
\item Finally find $n - |A_k|$ sets in $2^{[x]}$ of all sizes strictly between $(|A_k|, n)$ such that they form a chain, and add them to the chain.
\end{enumerate}

Note that by this method, you can form any maximal chain of $2^{[x]}$ which contains all the $A_i$.
Now we count how many distinct outcomes there are of performing the above procedure.

\begin{enumerate}
\item There are $|A_1|!$ ways of doing step 1.
\item There are $\product_{i,j | j-i = 1} (|A_j| - |A_i|)!$ ways of doing step 2. This is because you can choose from $(|A_j| - |A_i|)$ elements for the first set you add, one fewer element for the next set, up til there is only one way to form the last set (then you have $A_j$).
\item There are $(n - |A_k|)!$ ways of doing step 3 by the same logic.
\end{enumerate}

The product of those three quantities gives the answer.


\question{2}
We observe that the size of intersection of $\mathcal{F}$ and any maximal chain of $2^{[n]}$,
is at most 2, since if there were 3 sets in common with the chain,
those 3 sets would form a chain which would break the constraint on $\mathcal{F}$ given in the problem.
With 2, you do not break the constraint.

The total number of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ that also exist in some maximal chain is at most $2n!$ (two in a maximal chain, and there are $n!$).

We can also count this quantity by counting the number of maximal chains containing $A$ for all $A \in \mathcal{F}$. This quantity is $\sum_{A \in \mathcal{F} |A|!(n-|A|)!$, as shown in the proof of Sperner's Theorem in lecture.

Then, we do some algebra:

$$ 1 \geq \sum_{A \in \mathcal{F}} \frac{|A|!(n-|A|)!}{2n!} = \sum_{A \in \mathcal{F}} \frac{1}{2{n}\choose{\floor{\frac{n}{2}}}} = \frac{\mathcal{F}}{2{n}\choose{\floor{\frac{n}{2}}}}$$

Which implies that $\mathcal{F} \geq 2{n}\choose{\floor{\frac{n}{2}}}$ and since $n$ is even, $\mathcal{F} \geq 2{n}\choose{\frac{n}{2}}$.
