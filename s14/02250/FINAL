1.            MODELING SHIT

    Difference equation vs differential equation
        Difference equation is for discrete time, 
        differen


    Paramters (rate constants)
    Boundary conditions (initial values)

        Let x be prety
            y be predators
            r and m are growth rates
            a and b are interactions rates

        dx/dt = rx - axy
        dy/dt = -my + bxy

    Numerical integration requires step size and integration method.

    Parameter lines tell you how a system acts differently for
        different parameter values.


    Phase plane/portrait:

        Plot two dependent variables, only t can be inferred
        Super-impose the direction of the gradient

    Kinetics:
        Plot dependent variable against time


    Timescale: amount of time to go from min to max at max rate

        tol × E
        --------
        dE / dt

    Enzyme is either free or complex, its mass is conserved
        E + C = E0 + C0


Parameter Estimation
    Linear fitting for linear models
    Iterative for nonlinear coupled models
    Sensible - if a parameter affects the thing you're measuring
    Identifiable - if you can identify a single, unique parameter value from data

Bootstrapping -> Cross-validation
    How do we estimate the error in the estimated parameters?
    Can repeat ﬁt for different subsets of the data and see how the estimated parameters vary
    This ultimately uses all of the data
