prokaryote dna/rna transcription translation
    circular chromosomes
    sequence motifs, operons
    precursor proteins

eukaryote
    gene = 1 pp seq
    TATA box
    RNA polymerase II
    pre-mRNA (RNA splicing, spliceosome)
    cap + poly A tail = mature mRNA
    5' UTR, 3' UTR has some info, it may tell longevity of mRNA
    alternative splicing

    Sanger sequencing, automation

protein sequencing
    Edman Degradation
        Use PTC to attach to the Amino end,
        pull it off along w the first base, recurse.
        However, errors accumulate, best case is about 10 at a time
        so split your protein using a protease, then do ED
    In a database, the sequence is predicted from DNA
    Experimental- mass spectrometry
