circular table
seat 1 is next to seat 6

constraints:
animals can't share seat
animals can't be next to empty seat
B - M must sit together
P, S, H not next to C
C in seat 1

Part 1: Formulate the problem as AC3 in two ways

What is AC3?
How do I get variables, domains, constraints (use modulo)?

Part 2: Run AC3 where values are number and give resulting domains of the variables.

Part 3: Run AC3 where values are not numbers, restrict domains to possibilities fond in previous part
        Draw the search tree for DFS. Priority is alphabetical. Stop when Hepsiba value found. What causes you to keep backgracking?

Part 4: What happens if you ran same search with forward checking? How does it prevent excessive backtracking?

Part 5: Use Minimum Remaining Values heuristic - What do you discover?
