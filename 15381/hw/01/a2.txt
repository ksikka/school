Some CSP abstract problem

Part 1: Eliminating constraints by altering domain of variable - use example
Part 2: Turn Ternary constraint into three Binary constraints
            Trick: Consider a new variable that takes on values that are pairs of other values, and consider constraints such as “Y is the first element of the pair Z”.)
Part 3: Generalize and determine number of binary constraints needed for n CSP.
Part 4: Give an example and explain why you might want to do this.
