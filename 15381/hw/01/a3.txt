N-Queens, with weights on the squares

Place N chess Queens on a board, minimize that big ugly function

Write a program to minimize loss function.

WeightedQueens -N [num_queens] -W [weight_function_id]

Sample output:

N=8
W=1
L=28
T=15.3    # sim anneal
alpha=0.2    # sim anneal
(0,0)
(1,1)
(2,2)
(3,3)
(4,4)
(5,5)
(6,6)
