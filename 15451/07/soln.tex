\question{3}{A Well-Separated Problem}
\part{a}
The problem is in NP because there exists a poly-time verifier as follows:

Define the proof of the solution as a K-element subset of X. We compute distances
between each pair of distinct points and check that that they are greater than or equal to $\Delta$.
If all pairs satisfy the condition, then we verify that this is a solution. Otherwise it is not.

The Well-Separated problem is in NP-Hard because the independent set decision problem which is NP-hard reduces to it.
The reduction is as follows:

\textbf{Independent set}\\
Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and integer $k$,\\
we want to output YES\\
if there exists a set of vertices of size $k$\\
such that no two of them are adjacent.

To craft our input to the Well-Separated oracle,\\
we construct a set $X$ from the vertices of $G$,\\
let $K = k$,\\
let $\Delta = 1.25$,\\
for all $i \in V$ let $d(i,i) = 0$,\\
for all $i,j \in V : i \neq j \wedge (i,j) \in E$ let $d(i,j) = 1$\\
for all $i,j \in V : i \neq j \wedge (i,j) \notin E$ let $d(i,j) = 1.5$

We pass this input to the well separated problem, which will return YES\\
if there exists a set of elements of size $K$ where all distances are greater than 1.25.

Observe these elements in $X$ map directly to vertices in $V$ which are not adjacent\\
due to the way we constructed the input to the Well-Separated problem.

Also note that the construction of $d$ correctly obeys the triangle inequality, because\\
two of the shortest distances $(1 + 1)$ is still greater than the longest distance $(1.5)$.


\part{b}
First we will present the algorithm, then prove its correctness.

\textbf{Algorithm:}\\
Call one set with separation at least $\Delta^{*} / 2$ set $C$.

We will maintain a vector of all points which are potentially in $C$, initially containing all points.

We will maintain a vector of points which we know are in $C$.

Pick a point $u$ potentially in $C$ that's not already in $C$, and examine how far away all other points are from it.
Remove all potential points not at least $\Delta^{*} / 2$ from $u$ from the set of points potentially in $C$.
Add $u$ to the set of known points $C$.

Perform this a total of $K$ times.

This guarantees that all points in $C$ will be at least $\Delta^{*} / 2$ away from each other since at each step we eliminate points which could invalidate this invariant.

Now we need a proof that we can perform this $K$ times, or in other words, we never run out of points potentially in $C$ from which to select at each iteration.

\textbf{Proof:}\\
We were allowed to assume there exists some set of $K$ points with separation $\Delta^{*}$.
For convenience, lets call these the optimal points.

Lets examine how many optimal points are eliminated from $C$ in one iteration of the algorithm.
If we select optimal point $u$, we will see that all the other optimal points are at least $\Delta^{*}$ away from $u$, and they will not be eliminated from $C$ in this iteration.
If we select non-optimal point $u$, we will see that at most one optimal point is less than $\Delta^{*} / 2$ away from $u$.

This due to the triangle inequality. Consider a nonoptimal point $u$, the nearest optimal point $v$, and any other optimal point $w$.

$$\Delta^{*} leq d(v,w) \leq d(v,u) + d(u,w)$$

Since $v$ no farther from  $u$ than $w$, $d(v,u)$ may be less than $\Delta^{*} / 2$, but $d(u,w)$ will certainly be at least $\Delta^{*} / 2$.

Therefore at most one optimal point is removed from $C$ in each iteration of the algorithm.

Therefore this algorithm can be run at least $K$ iterations before running out of points to select.

\part{c}
Modify the algorithm from B to return NONE if it runs out of points potentially in $C$ that are not already in $C$.
Obseve that the optimum separation delta may only be one of $\binom{|X|}{2}$ values: the distances $d(i,j) : i \neq j$.
Sort the values from highest to lowest, and run the algorithm with these values.
Return the none-NONE answer corresponding to the input with highest $\Delta^{*}$
