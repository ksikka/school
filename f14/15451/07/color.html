<h3>A problem and an infinite sequence of problems.</h3>
Consider the problem
<blockquote>
COLORABILITY<br>
Input: A graph G and a positive integer k.<br>
Question: Is G k-colorable?
</blockquote>
and, for each positive integer k, consider the problem
<blockquote>
k-COLORABILITY<br>
Input: A graph G.<br>
Question: Is G k-colorable?
</blockquote>

<p><hr>
<h3>Two observations.</h3>
Trivially, for each positive integer k, 
<blockquote>
k-COLORABILITY reduces to COLORABILITY.
</blockquote>
In addition, for each positive integer k, 
<blockquote>
k-COLORABILITY reduces to (k+1)-COLORABILITY:
</blockquote>
if G' denotes the graph arising from G by adding a new vertex and making this 
new vertex adjacent to all the old vertices, then G is k-colorable if and 
only if G' is (k+1)-colorable.

<h3>A theorem of Lov&aacute;sz</h3>

L&aacute;szl&oacute; Lov&aacute;sz (Coverings and coloring of
hypergraphs,<EM> Proceedings of the Fourth Southeastern Conference on
Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Computing,</EM> Utilitas Math.,
Winnipeg, Man., 1973, pp. 3--12.) proved that
<center>
COLORABILITY reduces to 3-COLORABILITY,
</center>
and so all the problems
<blockquote>
3-COLORABILITY,<br>
4-COLORABILITY,<br>
5-COLORABILITY,<br>
...<br>
COLORABILITY<br>
</blockquote>
are equivalent.<br>

<h3>A plan for the reduction</h3>

Given a graph G and a positive integer k, we are required to construct 
quickly a graph H such that
<blockquote>
H is 3-colorable if and only if G is k-colorable.
</blockquote>
The idea is to build H around a rectangular <em>screen</em>, an array with 
k rows that correspond to the colors for use in G and with n columns that 
correspond to the n vertices of G. To this screen, we will attach a number 
of <em>peripherals</em> whose function is to coerce every 
3-coloring of H into having the following properties:
<ol type=i>
<li> only two of the three colors appear on the screen
</ol>
and that these two colors can be named "green" and "red" in such a way 
that
<ol type=i start=2>
<li> in each column (1,u), (2,u), ..., (k,u) of the screen,<br>
at least one vertex (i,u) is colored green and
<li> for each pair v,w of adjacent vertices and for each color i,<br>
at least one of the two vertices (i,v) and (i,w) is colored red. 
</ol>
If we manage to accomplish this plan, then every 3-coloring of H will 
point out a k-coloring f of G: specifically, f(u) is any i such that 
vertex (i,u) is colored green.<br>

<p><hr>
<h3>A peripheral to enforce property (i)</h3> 

We begin the construction of H with the vertices of the screen and no
edges at all; to enforce property (i), we add a new vertex b and make it
adjacent to all the vertices of the screen. Since we are free to name
the three colors in any 3-coloring of H whatever we want, we might as well 
call the color of b "blue" and to call the two other colors "green" and "red". 
Now property (i) is forced.<br>

<p><hr>
<h3>Peripherals to enforce property (ii)</h3> 

There is no loss of generality in assuming that k is odd. (If k
happens to be even, then we may replace k by k+1 and replace G by G'
that consists of G and a new vertex adjacent to all the vertices of G:
now G is k-colorable if and only if G' is (k+1)-colorable.) Under this
assumption, we may enforce property (ii) by adding to H one odd cycle
on k new vertices for each of the n columns of the screen, then matching
the k new vertices with the k vertices of the column, and making each
vertex adjacent to its mate: if all the vertices of the column were
colored by the same color, then the k vertices of the odd cycle would
have to be colored by the remaining two colors, which is impossible.<br>

<p><hr>
<h3>Peripherals to enforce property (iii)</h3> 

So far "green" and "red" have been interchangeable. We will now break
the symmetry by adding to H a new vertex named g and making g adjacent to 
b: the color of g cannot be blue and we might just as well call it green. 
To enforce property (iii), we add to H three vertices and six edges 
for each choice of i, v, and w such that i is one of the k colors for use in G 
and v,w are two adjacent vertices of G. The three new vertices, x, y, and z, 
form a triangle; the six new edges are the three edges of the triangle plus 
the three edges
<blockquote>
(x,(i,v)), (y,(i,w)), (z,g).
</blockquote>
If both (i,v) and (i,w) were colored green, then all three vertices x,
y, z of the triangle would have to be colored red or blue, which is
impossible.<br>

<p><hr>
<h3>From a k-coloring of G to a 3-coloring of H.</h3> 

Now the construction of H is complete. It follows from what we have
said so far that every 3-coloring of H has properties (i), (ii), (iii), 
and so it yields a k-coloring f of G by letting f(u) be any i such that 
(i,u) is colored green. Conversely, every k-coloring f of G yields a 
3-coloring of H: first, each vertex (i,u) of the screen can be colored 
<blockquote>
green if f(u)=i,<br>
red &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
otherwise
</blockquote>
and then this 2-coloring of the screen can be extended into a
3-coloring of the entire H as follows. The special vertex b is colored
blue and the special vertex g is colored green.  As for the n odd
cycles that enforce property (ii), each of them corresponds to one of
the n columns of the screen; its k vertices are matched with the k
vertices of the column;of these k vertices, k-1 are red and one is
green. The mate of the green vertex on the cycle gets colored red; the
colors on the remaining k-1 vertices of the cycle alternate between
green and blue. As for the various triangles xyz that enforce property
(iii), its vertex z always gets colored red; one of the vertices
(i,v), (i,w) is colored red and its neighbor in the triangle gets
colored green; the other one of the vertices (i,v), (i,w) is colored
red or green and its neighbor in the triangle gets colored blue.<br>
