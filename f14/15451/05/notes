Is there one edge that partitions it k and n - k?


make a table


Look at the k = 2 case.

For each node, put it in A and look at children.
  


   X
 /  \   
X    X  


For each node, for each k, you have a set A and B representing the (k, subn - k) partitioning
which minimizes number of split edges in that subtree.

To compute T[n][k] minimizing split edges:
  if k is 0:
      return ({all nodes}, {})
  if n has left:
      Al, Bl = T[n->left][k-1]
  if n has right:
      Ar, Br = T[n->right][k-1]
  A = n + Al + Ar
  
  if k is 1, A = A and return the rest as B
  if k is 2, take X as A, then either take left or right as B. (creates one split edge but subtree split edges
      are minimized.
  if k is 3, take X as A, then take left and right as A.
